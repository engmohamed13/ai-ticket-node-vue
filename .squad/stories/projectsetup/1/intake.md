# Story intake

Fill this template for each story you want planned. Keep it copy-paste-friendly: the planner reads **this file and the files in `attachments/`**, nothing else.

- Folder: `.squad/stories/projectsetup/1/intake.md`
- Binaries (screenshots, PDFs, exports): put them in `attachments/` next to this file and list them below.
- Do **not** rely on external links (tracker URLs, wiki, chat) — the planner cannot open them. Paste the content you want considered.

This is **not** an implementation prompt. It is the input to the plan-generation meta-prompt bundled with squad-kit (`generate-plan.md` in the installed package).

---

## Feature

- **Feature name (display):**
- **Feature slug (folder under `plans/`):** `projectsetup`

## Tracker (metadata only)

- **Tracker type:** `azure`
- **Work item id:** `1` *(used in filenames and plan tables; fill manually if empty)*
- **Work item type:** `User Story`
- **Status:** `New`
- **Assignee:** `mohamedhagag191`
- **Labels:** ``

External tracker links are **not** followed by the planner. Keep the id for naming and traceability only.
